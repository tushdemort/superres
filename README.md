# superres
The program uses openCV and python to upscale images

 Install OpenCV with the contrib modules (containing dnn_superres)
 
 The pre-trained model(LapSRN_x8.pb) is already included.
 
 To upscale your own image, insert your picture name at "image = cv2.imread('sample.jpeg')"
 instead of sample.jpeg
